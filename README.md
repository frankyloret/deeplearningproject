## Running a Development Server

To start a local development server execute the following command inside the root folder of this project:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

This will start a local server and automatically convert the markdown files to html files.

Open a browser to the web address shown by the `npm run` command. Most typically this is [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

```
